#' Current Incidents Feed (GeoJSON)
#' This feed contains a list of current incidents from the NSW RFS, 
#' and includes location data and Major Fire Update summary information where available. 
#' Click through from the feed to the NSW RFS website for full details of the update. 
#' GeoJSON is a lightweight data standard that has emerged to support the sharing of 
#' information with location or geospatial data. 
#' It is widely supported by modern applications and mobile devices.
